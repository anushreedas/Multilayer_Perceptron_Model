# Multilayer Perceptron Model


q1a.py : This program implements a single hidden layer MLP and performs gradient-checking for 'xor.dat'.

q1b.py : This program train the previous single hidden layer MLP on the 'spiral_train.dat' and then plot its decision boundary

q1c.py : This program fits the previous maximum entropy model to the given IRIS dataset,
where parameter optimization operates with mini-batches and
estimates accuracy by using the validation/development dataset given.

Run mnist_numpy.py file before q2.py

q2.py : This program fits the previous MLP network to the MNIST training set,
where parameter optimization operates with mini-batches and
estimates accuracy by using the validation/development dataset given.
Finally, the model is tested on test set by checking accuracy of the model for every class
